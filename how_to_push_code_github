i have code locally on laptop but wanted to push it to my git account at : https://github.com/Sameershaik63 

Got it üëç ‚Äî you already have your code locally and want to push it to your GitHub account at [github.com/Sameershaik63](https://github.com/Sameershaik63).

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide (assuming you already have Git installed):

---

### 1. Create a new repo on GitHub

1. Go to your GitHub account: [Sameershaik63](https://github.com/Sameershaik63).
2. Click the **+** ‚Üí **New repository**.
3. Give it a **name** (say `my-project`) ‚Üí leave it empty (don‚Äôt initialize with README if you already have files locally).
4. Copy the repo URL (either HTTPS or SSH, e.g. `https://github.com/Sameershaik63/my-project.git`).

---

### 2. Initialize Git locally

Open a terminal in your project folder and run:

```bash
# go inside your project folder
cd path/to/your/project

# initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# add all files
git add .

# commit
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

---

### 3. Link local repo to GitHub

If using HTTPS:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sameershaik63/my-project.git
```

If using SSH (make sure your SSH keys are added to GitHub):

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:Sameershaik63/my-project.git
```

---

### 4. Push code to GitHub

```bash
git branch -M main   # renames master to main if needed
git push -u origin main
```

---

‚úÖ Done! Your code should now be live in your GitHub repo.

Do you want me to write the exact commands tailored for **an existing repo you‚Äôve already created on GitHub** (instead of making a new one)?
